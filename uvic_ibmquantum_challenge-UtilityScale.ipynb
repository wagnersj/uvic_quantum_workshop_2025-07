    "## Challenge: Utility-scale Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how to create large circuits that use over 100 qubits. This lab is inspired by a research paper published by IBM in June 2023 entitled ***Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance*** in the journal Nature (see paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06096-3)). In the paper, researchers demonstrated meaningful computations of a real physics problem using over 100 qubits with high fidelity results. At this scale, the computations were beyond the capability of classical computers to perform the same computation using brute-force classical algorithms. This is what we refer to as **utility-scale quantum computing**. Programmers need to be mindful of the topology of the quantum processor in order to implement circuits that are both efficient and that will produce high fidelity results. The paper's authors took this into account in their computations. They also used techniques that were able to overcome noise and errors in the system using a combination of error suppression and error mitigation methods.\n",

This lab has 5 graded exercises.\n",

    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper ***Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance*** considered a physics problem on the dynamics of a lattice of particles with a \"spin\" property. The spins of the system are influenced by a global transerve field. Mathematically, the system is described by the following Hamiltonian operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "$H = -J \\sum_{i,j}{Z_i Z_j} + h \\sum_i X_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J$ is the coupling coefficient of nearest neighbour spins, $h$ is the global transverse field coefficient, and $Z$ and $X$ are the Pauli Z and Pauli X operator, respectively. Spin dynamics can be simulated over time using a technique known as Trotterization, which breaks up the computation into short time steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particles in the lattice can be arranged in a multitude of ways. In the simplest case, the spins can be a one-dimensional chain with each spin interacting with up to two nearest-neighbours. For the paper, the authors considered a two-dimensional lattice arranged in a heavy-hexagonal pattern, with each spin interacting with up to 3 nearest-neighbours. "

    "#### Exercise 1a: Constructing a custom gate\n",
    "\n",
    "The first exercise will be to create a two-qubit circuit that represents the implementation of a high-level gate used in the paper: the $R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ gate. This gate is used to simulate the $Z_i Z_j$ terms in the Hamiltonian equation above. There is an implementation of this gate in Qiskit (see [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.RZZGate)). The parameter $\\theta$ represents a rotation angle. The generic $R_{ZZ}(\\theta)$ gate can be implemented with more common gates in a number of ways. In the paper, the authors considered the specific angle $\\theta = -\\pi/2$. In this case, the $R_{ZZ}(-\\pi/2)$ gate can be implemented as follows:\n",

The $\\dag$ symbol on the gate signifies that the gate is the \"adjoint\" version of the gate, which in this case means a negative phase shift instead of a positive one. See [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.SdgGate) on how to use this gate in Qiskit.\n",
    "- **$\\sqrt{Y}$ (and $\\sqrt{Y}^\\dag$)**: the square root Y gate (and it's adjoint). This rotates a qubit about it's Y-axis by $\\pi/2$. It's similar to the $\\sqrt{X}$ gate that you may have noticed in transpiled circuits, except that it involves the Y-axis instead of the X-axis. Qiskit does not have a ready-made $\\sqrt{Y}$ gate available. You'll need to find an alternative using one of the standard gates available in Qiskit (see [here](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/circuit_library#standard-gates))."

We can calculate the gate depth of this circuit in terms of the number of sequential two-qubits gates that need to be executed. Since two-qubit gates, such as CNOT, tend to be the longest duration and the most error-prone gates on real hardware, the two-qubit gate depth of a circuit is a good indication of well the circuit will perform.

An observable is defined using a set of Pauli operators, specified using the I, Z, X, Y operators in Pauli \"strings\". The quantity we are interested in measuring in this lab is the average magnetization $M_z$ of the spins along the $z$-axis. For this, we need to take a measurement of all of the qubits in the $Z$ basis (which is just the standard measurement basis on IBM Quantum systems), compute an expectation value of the observable for each qubit, and then compute the average of the expected values. First, we need to define the observable operators for the measurements. In this case, it will be a set of Pauli strings with a single $Z$ operator at the position of the qubit to measure, and $I$ operators on other qubits. For instance, the Pauli string for the observable on the 5-th qubit will be ```IIIIIIIIIIIZIIII``` for a 16-qubit circuit.

    "\n",
    "Quantum computers presently exhibit noise and errors that can impact the results of a quantum computation. In the future, quantum error correction protocols will be implemented in order to deal with such noise and errors. However, we can still improve the results obtained on present quantum computers by using a set of clever techniques that suppress and mitigate noise. This is what was done in the paper ***Evidence for the utility of quantum computing before fault tolerance***. The key error mitigation and suppression techniques used are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pauli twirling**: This is used to mitigate the effects of gate errors. Pauli twirling is implemented by sandwiching a chosen set of gates with randomly chosen single-qubit Pauli gates in such a way that the ideal effect of the gate remains the same. It has the effect of transforming any quantum channel into a Pauli channel. Performed alone, it can mitigate coherent noise because coherent noise tends to accumulate quadratically with the number of operations, whereas Pauli noise accumulates linearly.\n",
    "- **Twirled readout error extinction (TREX)**: This technique is similar to Pauli twirling, except it is applied to the measurement operation to mitigate readout error errors. It is used when estimating Pauli observable expectation values. TREX requires executing additional calibration circuits, which introduces a small overhead.\n",
    "- **Zero-noise extrapolation**: This is a technique for mitigating errors in estimating expectation values of observables. ZNE consists of two stages: 1) *Noise amplification*, where the original quantum circuit is executed multiple times at different noise rates, and 2) *Extrapolation*, where the ideal result is estimated by extrapolating the noisy expectation value results to the zero-noise limit. Both the noise amplification and extrapolation stages can be implemented in many different ways. Here we use a ZNE technique called *Probablistic Error Amplification (PEA)*, which provides a more accurate approach to error amplification through noise learning. PEA performs preliminary experiments to reconstruct the noise and then uses this information to perform an accurate amplification. For utility-scale experiments, PEA is often the best choice. Note that PEA incurs significantly more runtime on the quantum computer as part of the noise learning process.\n",
